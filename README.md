## Functions
We essentially have a few functions that helps us modify the doubly linked list in different ways. We have functions that allow us to insert nodes before or after a target, destroy the list, find specific nodes within the list, and sorting the list by value. There are a few other functions we have created as well. As far as the stack goes, we also have a few functions that allows us to push and pop values on or off the stack and we are able to return a value. And of course, we have a function that allows us to check if the doubly linked list/stack is empty or not.

## Usage
In order to run the program, you can open the files in visual studio code and run it through the C language compiler extension within visual studio code. Run the doublylinkedlist file and the stack file in VSC C language compiler in order to get the result.
